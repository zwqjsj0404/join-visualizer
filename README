Visualize SQL queries to get a better understanding of them, especially when many tables are joined. See example.png for an example.

In contrast to other tools, this one does not need a database connection. It examines queries on a per-string basis and tries to read as much of the database schema from it as possible. My plan is to map the complete relational algebra to it.

The tool to visualize the queries is Graphviz.

An SQL parser is still missing, which is subject to additional development.
